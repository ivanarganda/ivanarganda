ABOUT ME:

I consider myself efficient, proactive, and self-taught, with skills for both teamwork and individual tasks.
My greatest potential lies in being self-taught because, as a result, I managed to grow, evolve, and learn all the technologies mentioned below.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH:

The following developments I describe below are all developed with ReactJS / JavaScript native / Bootstrap / CSS3 flexbox / HTML5 / PHP OOP / PDO MySQL / PDO Firebird / WebServices REST, TCP, or FTP.

At GROUP BACKUP (a company focused on the development of electronic invoicing, records, and electronic signatures):

  -Regarding front-end development:

    As it was my first job and I had no prior experience as a developer, I didn't do much design, but during my time there, I managed to learn Bootstrap since it was widely used at that time and essential for meeting tight client deadlines. In the last few months, I also learned CSS3 flexbox as it became popular in web technology and was very           practical for design. I used these technologies for Bootstrap applications for data management in tables and forms. Still, for most of the forms, I used CSS3 since Bootstrap had some limitations.

  -Regarding FullStack development:

    I primarily developed applications to manage both user data and database data provided by clients, with the goal of improving optimization and management.
    In the last few months, I worked on an inventory system to handle stored invoices, which the application managed in tables with necessary filters.

At PREVILABOR (a Occupational Risk Prevention company focused on the development of invoicing, documents, records, and health-related tasks such as medical examinations, analytics, and evaluations for various companies, ensuring the safety of their facilities and employees):

  -Regarding front-end development:

    I designed various elements of applications using Bootstrap and CSS3 flexbox, including forms, selectors, and tables, both manual and dynamic, to enhance the user experience. I mostly focused on forms, as most applications were used to manage Excel, PDF, or Word documents. I worked on different platforms, including:
    In WordPress: WordPress is a CMS (Content Management System) that comes with pre-implemented CSS3 frameworks. While it offered templates, I was limited in terms of Bootstrap due to predefined classes, so I often used CSS3 and flexbox to add new functionalities and design elements.
    In the root directory of the Apache server: Since WordPress was not used here, I had more freedom to design from scratch, using Bootstrap for quick projects and CSS3 for custom functionalities integrated into the required applications.รง
    
  -Regarding FullStack development:

    I worked on software development projects at Echevarne, and one of the notable achievements was the creation of a PHP-based web service. This service facilitated the sending and retrieval of results for analysts who sent us their data, significantly reducing the execution time of this process. We received samples at Echevarne's laboratories,        and they sent us data files that we had to process to provide workers with the results of their tests.
    During my time there, the company faced challenges with their ERP system (Enterprise Resource Planning), especially in generating PDFs for worker requests, causing significant delays. To address this, I took the initiative to develop an application using asynchronous PHP, ReactJS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This new application allowed users to        generate PDFs and perform the same functions as the ERP, resulting in a substantial reduction in execution times and increased worker productivity.
    Another situation arose where workers needed to generate PDF documents with digital signatures, but the existing solution was costly. Therefore, I undertook the development of an algorithm within the code to handle PDF document generation with digital signatures. Although it was a complex task and took some time, I successfully completed it         ahead of schedule, impressing my boss with the incredible solution I delivered.
