About me: 

I consider eficiency, proactive and teacherself, with skills both for teamwork and task making 

Current situation me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently searching job and learning new technologies and programming languages. Here I deployes different projects developed with HTML,CSS,ReactJS or JavaScript Vanilla with Asyncronous fetch and PHP
- ðŸŒ± Also I am learning skills about comunication in english and programming logical.

Goals: 

I worked on software development projects at Echevarne, and one of the most notable accomplishments was the creation of a PHP-based web service. This service facilitated the forwarding and retrieval of results for analysts who sent us their data. We managed to significantly reduce the execution time for this process.

During my time at Previlabor, the company faced challenges with its ERP system, particularly in generating PDFs for worker requests. The existing system was causing significant delays. To address this issue, I took the initiative to develop an application using PHP, asynchronous ReactJS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This new application allowed users to generate PDFs and perform the same functions as the ERP. The results were outstanding, with a substantial reduction in execution times, leading to increased worker productivity.

Another situation arose at Previlabor where workers needed to generate PDFs but lacked a digital signature feature. Acquiring commercial signature solutions proved costly, so I embarked on developing an algorithm within the code to handle PDF generation with digital signatures. While it was a complex task and took some time, I successfully completed it ahead of schedule. My boss was pleasantly surprised by the incredible solution I delivered.
