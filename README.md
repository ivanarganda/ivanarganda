Despite having no prior experience with Vue.js, I am confident that I can learn and adapt quickly due to my solid foundation in technologies and self-taught ability. Vue.js offers a significantly lower learning curve compared to React, allowing me to confidently tackle new challenges.

With over 7 years of web development experience, including 2 years of corporate work, I have specialized in creating and optimizing software solutions for both front-end and back-end. I have used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and NodeJS Express, among others. In my previous position at Previlabor, I made a significant contribution to improving internal processes, notably implementing an automatic document generation system and a REST web API service for Laboratorios Echevarne, which resulted in a 15% efficiency increase. Additionally, I achieved a notable optimization in the generation of PDF documents in the company's ERP, reducing processing time from one hour to just 4 seconds.

At Grupo Backup, I developed projects using PHP and JavaScript natively to manage invoices, which considerably increased production and sales by eliminating the need for paper documents. In addition to professional projects, I have also created personal projects:

Both projects are available in my portfolio on GitHub, which you can visit at https://igvdeveloper.com, where I provide details about their functionality and code.
PHPTESTER: An application that allows you to compile PHP code, from basic to advanced. It offers a panel where you can adjust the font size and two text areas: one on the left to write the code and another on the right to see the output, whether successful or with corresponding errors.
Highlighted skills: Databases, Bootstrap, Web Performance, Optimization, Independent Work, Attention to Detail, CSS Flexbox, Socket Programming, JavaScript.

SPA User CRUD: An application that allows you to add, delete, and update users asynchronously using JavaScript fetch, without the need to refresh the browser. This improves the user experience and makes the browser more useful.
Highlighted skills: Databases, Bootstrap, Independent Work, React.js, MySQL, CSS Flexbox, JavaScript, PHP.

Dashboard Store: A dashboard for an online store with a shopping cart. You can add products to the cart, temporarily save them as favorites, and, if you register and log in, manage your orders, receive notifications from other users, and share your purchases.
The code for this project is available on GitHub for review.

My professional career began as a self-taught individual from home, driven by my passion for learning, taking on new challenges, and constantly improving my programming, logic, and performance skills. My focus in this field is not limited to fulfilling a dream of working in front of a computer, but is based on my determination to stand out and my desire to share my knowledge with the world. The self-taught approach has allowed me to acquire additional skills and learn new technologies, such as Tailwind and MaterialUI, which have made me more agile and versatile in development.
